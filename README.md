# Filmaholic

A Twitch Themed Movie Search App Specially & Precisely Designed for Filmaholic's.

## Idea

> “The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring."   
	 - Paul Rand

Twitch is the world's leading video platform and community for gamers. It has best looking Web UI in the world of Internet. I took it as a reference. Simply I just Mixed *Twitch Ultraviolet UI* with *Movie Database(TMDB)*. The final result is 😍.

## Code Technologies

 -  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as a Front-End Framework(Compiler). [Because](https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao)

 - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool for Svelte.
	> Svelte is *Faster* but with Vite it is *the *Fastest**

 - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is faster & robust then I expected.

	#### API's & NPM Packages
- For Movie Database [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/). It is the only best choice in entire internet.
- [svelte-click-outside](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-click-outside) is a small helper component that lets you listen for clicks _outside_ of an element.
